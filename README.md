## FAQ ##
* Why am I doing this in general?
	- I have always thought making a game was cool.
	- The Linux community needs more games.
	- Black and White is a great game, and we need an updated version for new gamers to experience.
* Why a Black and White clone?
	- I really like "God" category games. Black and White was one of the best and had some really good mechanics that I never see anymore.
	- Black and White 2 was a terrible second game. They lost sight of what made the original Black and White so interesting.
* Why Godot?
	- FREE. MIT license.
	- All files are saved in ascii text. Great for git and linux in general.
	- I am an Embedded Systems programmer. I cannot make an engine as good as Godot.
	- I am on covid-19 quarantine. I don't have the time to build something that experts have already done.
